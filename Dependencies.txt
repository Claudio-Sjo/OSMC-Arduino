The Arduino part of the project depends on IRLib2
https://github.com/cyborg5/IRLib2
please note that Arduino IDE uses a buggy version of gcc, in order to make it work you need to follow
the instructions given at https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=574020.0

In details the workaround is:

In the Arduino IDE
    Tools > Board > Boards Manager
    Wait for downloads to finish.
    When you move the mouse pointer over "Arduino AVR Boards", you will see a "Select version" dropdown menu appear. Select "1.6.21".
    Click "Install".
    Wait for installation to finish.
    Click "Close".



Due to a bug, this alternative workaround doesn't work with Arduino IDE 1.8.6, but it will work with any other version of the Arduino IDE.

If you have File > Preferences > Check for updates on startup checked, the Arduino IDE may occasionally notify you that a new version of Arduino AVR Boards is available, you'll need to refrain from updating back to the new Arduino AVR Boards version, 
otherwise you'll be back to seeing the segmentation fault error again.

The Raspberry Pi part of the project depends on http://wiringpi.com/
The installation of wiringPi is automated by means of install.sh
